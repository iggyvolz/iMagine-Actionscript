## Bug reports
Before filing a bug report, please do the following:
*Look over issues to see if it's already been reported.  It's not the end of the world if we have a duplicate issue (we will simply close it), but it's far easier for both us and you if we keep everything on one issue.
*Run version and paste the output.  Version was added in version 0.3 (note that it may be a little buggy - make sure you run make generate-version-file before running make test; this was fixed after the release), and it includes the latest tag, with the latest commit message and commit hash if you are not directly on the tag
*Run make test if you are compiling yourself and report any failed tests in your issue.  This helps diagnose the issue easier.
