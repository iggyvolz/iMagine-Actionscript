	Please note: This program is in development.  The help page may not be completely up-to-date, please <a href="https://github.com/iggyvolz/iMagine/issues">check current issues</a> or, if none exist, <a href="https://github.com/iggyvolz/iMagine/issues/new">add a new one</a>.
	<h2>Download</h2>
	<p>This application is written in ActionScript.  Therefore it must be compiled before it can be run.  As we are not at a stable release point, the quickest and surest way to do it is to compile it yourself.  To do this, enter the following in your terminal (assuming Unix or Mac):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>cd ~</li>
    <li>git clone https://github.com/iggyvolz/iMagine ## Clone iMagine</li>
    <li>cd iMagine ## Move into iMagine</li>
    <li>git submodule update --init --recursive ## Clone ASUnit</li>
    <li>cd ~</li>
    <li>wget http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flex/sdk/flex_sdk_4.6.zip ## Download the Flex SDK</li>
    <li>unzip flex_sdk_4.6.zip ## Unzip the Flex SDK</li>
    <li>echo "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/flex_sdk/bin">>~/.profile ## Add the Flex SDK Bin to your $PATH</li>
    <li>source ~/.profile ## Re-run ~/.profile so you don't have to restart terminal</li>
    <li>cd iMagine ## Move into iMagine</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now you can just run make build debug and open up iMagine!  Note that in certain versions of OS X you may need to follow the instructions <a href="https://github.com/iggyvolz/iMagine/wiki/Build-instructions">here</a> to use the 64-bit Java player instead of the 32-bit player.</p>
  <p>If you would prefer not to compile yourself, the latest successfully compiling binary is pushed <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62666232/iMagine.swf">here</a> about 1 minute after each commit.</p>
  <p>If you would prefer to simply use point-releases (these point-releases are tested more thoroughly), please see the <a href="https://github.com/iggyvolz/iMagine/releases">Github Releases Page</a>.</p>
  <h2>Syntax</h2>
	<p>All commands are case-insensitive and will be converted immediately to all lowercase.  The syntax is: person.action(parameter).  However, the person and/or the parameter can be omitted for some functions.  For example, the function version requires no name or parameters.  Any of these will do the same thing:<p>
	<ul>
		<li>i.version()</li>
		<li>i.version(foo)</li>
		<li>i.version</li>
		<li>version()</li>
		<li>version(foo)</li>
		<li>version</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As you noticed in the example above, you can use the person i.  This is the person you are currently playing as (you can switch using the switchto command).  You can also refer to anyone by name in the person spot (for example, tony.reset).</p>
	<h2>People</h2>
	<h3>Tony</h3>
	Tony is selected by default.  For more info, see the <a href="http://magination.wikia.com/wiki/Tony_Jones_(TV_Series)">Magi Nation Wiki</a>.
	<h4>Furok</h4>
	Furok is Tony's main dream creature and the only one currently implemented in the game. (see <a href="https://github.com/iggyvolz/iMagine/issues/12">#12</a>)
	<h3>Edyn</h3>
	For more info, see the <a href="http://magination.wikia.com/wiki/Edyn">Magi Nation Wiki</a>.
	<h4>Ugger</h4>
	Ugger is Edyn's main dream creature and the only one currently implemented in the game. (see <a href="https://github.com/iggyvolz/iMagine/issues/13">#13</a>)
	<h3>Strag</h3>
	For more info, see the <a href="http://magination.wikia.com/wiki/Strag">Magi Nation Wiki</a>.
	<h4>Freep</h4>
	Freep is Strag's main dream creature and the only one currently implemented in the game. (see <a href="https://github.com/iggyvolz/iMagine/issues/14">#14</a>)
	<h2>Functions</h2>
	<h3>Changeto</h3>
	<p class="italic">Note - Name is technically optional, but this function is pointless if the name is not included or "i" is used.  Name must be a valid person.  Parameters are optional and will be ignored if included.</p>
	This changes the value of the person i (or no person) to the person in the name.
	<h3>Magine</h3>
	<p class="italic">Note - Name is optional, defaulting to "i".  If included, it must be a valid person.  Parameter is required to be a valid dream creature that is owned by the person listed in name and be in the dream plane before being magined.  In addition, the person must have at least 100 energy to spend on magining the dream creature.</p>
	This "magines" a Dream Creature.  It costs 100 energy (subject to change).  It brings the Dream Creature in parameter from the Dream Plane (where they rest) to the real world, where they can fight (coming soon).  For more info, see the <a href="http://magination.wikia.com/wiki/Animite#In_the_TV_Series">Magi Nation Wiki</a>.  Person must be a valid person.  Parameter must be a Dream Creature that is in the Dream Plane.  Person must have Parameter's Animite (the stone used to magine dream creatures), that is, you cannot magine someone else's Dream Creature.
	<h3>ToTheDreamPlane</h3>
	<p class="italic">Note - Name is required to be a valid dream creature that is in battle before this action is called.  Parameter is optional and will be ignored if included.</p>
	This returns a Dream Creature to the Dream Plane.  For more info, see the <a href="http://magination.wikia.com/wiki/Animite#In_the_TV_Series">Magi Nation Wiki</a>.  Person must be a Dream Creature that is active (not in the Dream Plane).  Parameter is ignored.
	<h3>Version</h3>
  <p class="italic">Note - Name and parameters are optional and will be ignored if included.</p>
  This returns the current version of the software.  If it is a development version, it will also include the latest commit number.
