Rationalization for fair use
============================

Magi-Nation and its respective characters, names, spells, etc. are copyrighted by Interactive Imagination Corporation, 2i, and Cookie Jar Entertainment. This game was created in the fan base and claims no affiliation with the copyright holders.
While the material falls under copyright, we believe that the iMagine project qualifies as "fair use" under United States copyright law.  As per the US code on fair use ([1][17 U.S.C. § 107.]), the criteria for fair use are:
> Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—

> (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
> 
> (2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
> 
> (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
> 
> (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
>
> The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.


Let us break down each one of these criteria.
> (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;

The iMagine project is completely non-profit, but not educational.

> (2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

The copyrighted work is a non-current television show which has not aired on television since 2010, and part of which (which this game is based upon) is uploaded to an online website (YouTube) for free viewing, and the remainder of the episodes are in the process of uploading (so "The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors." applies here).

> (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;

Short quotes as well as names of various characters, names, spells, et cetera are used, along with the generic outline of the story.

> (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

The work is not being sold commercially as a whole in the United States at this time.  It is available for free viewing on the Internet (YouTube).  Eight episodes are being sold as DVDs, however content these episodes will not be used until they are uploaded freely to the Internet.

A considerable amount of information for the game is taken from the <a href="http://magination.wikia.com/">Magi Nation Wiki</a>, including names of characters, statistics, plot line summaries, etc.  These are used under the terms of the [2][Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License 3.0 (Unported) license (CC-BY-SA)].
